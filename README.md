Welcome to my calculator app!

A simple calculator running on a basic page developed in vanilla JavaScript.

It takes maximum of 2 inputs of infinite amount of digits.

The change-sign and dot buttons work now but my method of adding decimals limits me to adding only one number with a decimal to the equation. At the moment in suggest to press "=" sign after adding decimals so to perform a basic equation (like 12.3 + 12.3) press buttons in that order: 12 "." 3 "=" "+" 12 "." 3 "="

"%" button calculates percentage of a number so 5%100 will return 5 and 1%1000 will return 10.

Bugs:

I can't process two negative numbers. If the first one is negative the whole calculation returns an error. However when the first number is positive everything works fine.
